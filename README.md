I love Front-end Development. I usually work out application develop with React-Native & Flutter. But I'm trying to work with web develop with React & Vue.js too. I'm interest in UI/UX. User's comfortable is the best over everything.

I love team project. I love communication. I really love organizations. I can do well to develop front-end alone, but I want to make products not alone. Two is better than one. Let's make together!

Little Waterdrops make Blue Whale.
